I stabilized remote MySQL access and environment configuration so everyone runs the same stack. I centralized .env files, corrected the DB_NAME and connection settings, and synced the live schema so migrations and ORM expectations match reality. Admin operations were verified end‑to‑end, removing a class of brittle “works‑on‑my‑machine” issues. Credentials and settings are now managed safely and predictably, speeding up onboarding and lowering deployment risk. This is the type of foundational work that keeps a team fast and secure.
