I focused on reducing friction so users find what they need without starting over. Inputs persist across refresh and navigation, zone selections dynamically cascade into hotel choices, and results preserve their state so context isn’t lost. Built with class‑based views and Tailwind, the UI stays clean and responsive while the logic remains maintainable. The net effect: fewer dead‑ends, fewer support pings, and a smoother path from intent to action.
