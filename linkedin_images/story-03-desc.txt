I refactored the data model to reflect how the business actually talks and operates. Bookings now carry first‑class fields for amount and status, relationships are explicit, and car_type_id was corrected to car_id with a safe, null‑aware one‑way option. I delivered migrations that preserved data and minimized disruption, then simplified queries and validations around those new invariants. Clearer models reduce bugs, make reporting trustworthy, and help developers move faster because the code mirrors the domain.
