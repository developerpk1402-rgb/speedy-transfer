I built a clean checkout data pipeline that payment providers can trust. Totals are normalized, payloads are validated, and every success or failure path leaves behind a Payment record for full traceability. This makes reconciliation straightforward and debugging fast, because there’s a single source of truth for what was attempted and what succeeded. The integration is resilient by design and ready for Stripe/PayPal or additional gateways.
