I codified real‑world constraints directly into the product so operations stay accurate. The checkout now blocks until vehicle capacity is satisfied and enforces a same‑destination rule that mirrors how trips are actually run. These rules are applied consistently at the boundaries (forms, services, and database), with tests to guard against regressions. The payoff is fewer operational mistakes and a clearer, more trustworthy experience for customers.
