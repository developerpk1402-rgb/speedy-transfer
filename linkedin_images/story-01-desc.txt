Jumped into a legacy Django codebase and took it from "can’t run" to productive in hours. I untangled a Pillow dependency conflict, aligned Python 3.11, Django 3.2, and MySQL versions, and established a clean, reproducible environment. With migrations unblocked and the dev server back online, the team regained the ability to iterate and ship. This is where I thrive: diagnosing unfamiliar stacks quickly, making pragmatic fixes, and creating guardrails so problems stay solved. The result was momentum and confidence—not just a one‑off rescue.
