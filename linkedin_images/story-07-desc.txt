I turned email from a black box into a reliable channel. The SMTP backend is correctly configured with TLS/SSL, environments are isolated (dev/stage vs production sender), and templates are tested end‑to‑end so content renders as expected. With clear configuration and dependable delivery, the team can ship notifications and receipts with confidence, without guesswork or manual retries.
